### Robot Tracker
The robot is a straightforward Java class that enables the creation of a Robot object and allows the user to move the robot in 4 different directions. The class also records the robot's movement history. In the RobotTester class, we test the movement function. At the conclusion, we print the position of our Robot's movement history to check whether it corresponds to the location we anticipated.
