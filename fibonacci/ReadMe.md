### Fibonacci
The user is asked for an integer number (n) in this Java programme, which then uses the input to generate a stream of n Fibonacci numbers and store them in an array list. The software prints out a stream of the Fibonacci numbers as a result of the computation, and if the user wants to know which Fibonacci number is kept at the x index, it prompts them to specify an integer.
