# Combo Lock Program 
This Java class simulates a basic combo lock that we frequently use to secure our school or gym lockers.
The user must first enter three integers to close the lock before they can utilise the left and right turn choices in the menu to unlock it.
Remember that EVERY combo lock must be turned left, then right, and then left again after being reset to zero.
